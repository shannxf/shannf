  Glad to meet you! \n\n
  
  My name's Xuan and I am enjoying my fantastic studying journey. Here I write about stuff that I am studying / working on. \n\n

  I am currently a master's student @ KU Leuven majoring in computer science. I obtained my bachelor's degree in computer science @ Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am passionate about HPC and its combination with AI. \n\n

  I have 5 lovely parrots (they are really cute little girls / guys!) and I love board games and travelling (travelling with board games would be extra fantastic). \n\n
