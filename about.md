- About me

    Hi there 👋 Glad to meet you!

    I am currently a master's student @ KU Leuven majoring in computer science. I obtained my bachelor's degree in computer science @ Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am passionate about HPC and its combination with AI.

    I have 5 lovely parrots (they are really cute little girls / guys!) and I love board games and travelling (travelling with board games would be extra fantastic). I'm listening to Rachmaninoff a lot these days.

- How to pronounce my name 🗣️:

    The pronunciation of "Xuan" is "shoo-an" but blended smoothly. It starts with "x", which is like an English "sh" but with the tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth, making a softer, more hissing sound (quite similar to the soft "ch" in German, like in "Ich"). The "uan" sounds like "w-en" in "when", but with a slightly rounded "w" sound at the beginning.
